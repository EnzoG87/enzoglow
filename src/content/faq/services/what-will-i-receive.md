Aside from receiving a refreshing service, I also provide a detailed consultation to provide you more insight on what ingredients, products, and methods are appropriate for your skin type or current skin condition.
My goal is to help you learn how to improve your skin with simple, holistic measures, identify possible skin triggers, and learn how to work with your skin by identifying what it needs in the short and long term.

Following the appointment, I provide a detailed summary of the appointment for you to refer to so that you can understand your skinâ€™s current condition and make adjustments with your at-home regimen and or lifestyle.
I always strive to keep things simple and minimalistic for you, and will only make suggestions that fit your lifestyle and budget.
